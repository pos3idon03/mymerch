# Banner Image Display Guide

## Overview
The banner component has been updated to better handle your 800x600 mobile-optimized images across all screen sizes.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Image Display Modes
- **`contain`** (default): Shows the entire image without cropping, maintaining aspect ratio
- **`cover`**: Fills the entire banner area, may crop parts of the image

### 2. Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Uses `cover` mode to fill space better
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Uses `contain` mode to show full image
- **Large screens (≥1200px)**: Optimized for `contain` mode with proper scaling

### 3. Background Fallback
- When using `contain` mode, a gradient background fills empty space
- Ensures the banner always looks good even with smaller images

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Recommended for 800x600 images)
```jsx
<Banner banners={banners} imageFit="contain" />
```

### For Full Coverage (if you want to fill the entire banner)
```jsx
<Banner banners={banners} imageFit="cover" />
```

### Custom Height Classes
You can also add custom height classes to the banner container:
```jsx
<section className="banner banner-height-small">
  <Banner banners={banners} imageFit="contain" />
</section>
```

## Image Optimization Recommendations

### For 800x600 Images (4:3 aspect ratio)
- Use `imageFit="contain"` for best results
- Images will be displayed in full without cropping
- Gradient background fills empty space on larger screens

### For Different Aspect Ratios
- **16:9 images**: Consider using `imageFit="cover"` for better visual impact
- **Square images**: Either mode works well
- **Portrait images**: `contain` mode recommended to avoid excessive cropping

## Technical Details

### CSS Classes Available
- `.banner-image-contain`: Forces contain mode
- `.banner-image-cover`: Forces cover mode
- `.banner-height-small`: 400px height
- `.banner-height-medium`: 600px height
- `.banner-height-large`: 800px height

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: ≤768px
- Tablet: 769px - 1199px
- Desktop: ≥1200px
- Large Desktop: ≥1600px

## Best Practices

1. **Upload high-quality images**: Even though they're optimized for mobile, higher resolution images look better on larger screens
2. **Test on different devices**: Check how your images look on various screen sizes
3. **Consider image content**: Images with important content in the center work better with `cover` mode
4. **Use consistent aspect ratios**: If possible, use similar aspect ratios across all banner images

## Troubleshooting

### Image appears too small on desktop
- This is expected behavior with `contain` mode
- The gradient background ensures the banner still looks professional
- Consider using `cover` mode if you want to fill the entire space

### Image is cropped too much
- Switch to `contain` mode
- Ensure important content is centered in your images

### Banner height issues
- Use the height utility classes to adjust banner size
- Default height is 600px, which works well for most use cases
